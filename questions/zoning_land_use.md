# Home much land do Single Detached Homes take up in Vancouver? ([Issue request](https://github.com/mountainMath/vanReData/issues/1))

### Takeaway
There are a number of ways to slice variations of this question. 

* 33% of overall land is taken up by single family properties, 34% of land is occupied by single family and duplex properties
* 35% of all households live on single family and duplex properties making up 81% of Vancouver's residential land,
while the remaining 65% of households live on 19% of the residential land.
* 42% of land is used for residential or mixed use properties, 81% of this residential land is used for single detached
and duplex properties. 

One can also look into what portion of the land is zoned exclusively for single family homes, but the answer to this
question becomes complicated. For example, RS zoned property includes parks, schools and other institutional uses like
assissted care facilities, none of which can be used for single family properties. Similarly it includes roads right of
ways that are also out of bounds for single family properties.
 
### Data sources
To compute those numbers one needs to consider the [Metro Vancouver land use dataset](http://www.metrovancouver.org/data),
for the land use data and Census Data for the household estimates.

### Reproducability

### Accuracy
There is a number of data accuracy issues, in particular the land use dataset is slightly out of date and there are some
complications matching census data with land use data. [TL;DR](http://doodles.mountainmath.ca/blog/2016/06/17/sdh-zoning-and-land-use/)
