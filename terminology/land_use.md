# Land Use

While zoning lays out what can be built on the land, land use looks at what actually has been built and how the building
is used. Metro Vancouver has a [good land use dataset](http://www.metrovancouver.org/data) that details how land is used
in Metro Vancouver, here is a (data heavy) [interactive map](http://mountainmath.ca/land_use/map) and one
[just for the City of Vancouver (plus Musqueam 2)](http://mountainmath.ca/land_use/map?zoom=13&lat=49.2544&lng=-123.1268&mu_filter=[%22VA%22]&lu_filter_n=[])
