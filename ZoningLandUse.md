# Zoning and Land Use

## Zoning
Land in Vancouver is divided into various zones, each zone comes with a
[set of bylaws](http://vancouver.ca/your-government/zoning-development-bylaw.aspx) that outline what can and cannot be built on
land in that zone. See the [City of Vancouver PDF version](http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/Zoning-Map-Vancouver.pdf) or
[this interactive map](http://mountainmath.ca/map/assessment?zoom=15&lat=49.2688&lng=-123.1308&layer=6).

## Land Use
While zoning lays out what can be built on the land, land use looks at what actually has been built and how the building
is used. Metro Vancouver has a [good land use dataset](http://www.metrovancouver.org/data) that details how land is used
in Metro Vancouver, here is a (data heavy) [interactive map](http://mountainmath.ca/land_use/map) and one
[just for the City of Vancouver (plus Musqueam 2)](http://mountainmath.ca/land_use/map?zoom=13&lat=49.2544&lng=-123.1268&mu_filter=[%22VA%22]&lu_filter_n=[])
